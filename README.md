# Fuel-Logger
A C# Project For Campus Wide Fuel Transaction Logging

I made this for work, after searching online for something similar. 

This application is intended to limit paper use in the maintenance department.
The application should allow for logging of fuel dispensed and fuel added to our on campus fuel tanks. 
There is no money involved, just simply inputting and outputting fuel. 

I know there are some issues with the code (SQL For example). 

However, this is my largest project I have made entirely by myself (Of course with the help of Google lol) 

Any insight would be much appreciated. 

As you can tell by my Github profile, this is also my first repository that I have posted. Not too sure if I am doing it right. 

Anyway, let me know if there are any questions and don't hold back on the comments!
